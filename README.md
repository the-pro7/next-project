# Welcome to my First Next.js Project

I hope you find this project to look at. Been coding in Reactjs for sometime now, and just wondered how Next.js would be like?!!

# Here's what I found

- Next.js is exceptional [nothing kike I've seen before]

- The new `app` router be something else
- I wish I started using it earlier (isn't so late though)
- Has in built optimization for images using `<Image />` from `next/image`
- Same for links using `<Link />` from `next/link`
